# Installation

1. Add surveyor to your Gemfile add haml:

gem "surveyor"
gem "haml"

Then run:

`bundle install`

2. Generate assets, run migrations:

`rails generate surveyor:install`
`rake db:migrate`

3. Try out the "kitchen sink" survey. The rake task above generates surveys from our custom survey DSL (a good format for end users and stakeholders).

`rake surveyor FILE=surveys/kitchen_sink_survey.rb`

4. Start up your app and visit:

http://localhost:3000/surveys

Try taking the survey and compare it to the contents of the DSL file kitchen\_sink\_survey.rb. See how the DSL maps to what you see.

There are two other useful rake tasks for removing (only surveys without responses) and un-parsing (from db to DSL file) surveys:

`rake surveyor:remove`
`rake surveyor:unparse`

# Customizing surveyor

Surveyor's controller, models, and views may be customized via classes in your app/models, app/helpers and app/controllers directories. To generate a sample custom controller and layout, run:

`script/rails generate surveyor:custom`

and read surveys/EXTENDING\_SURVEYOR

# Requirements

Surveyor depends on:

* Ruby (1.8.7 - 1.9.2)
* Rails 3.x
* HAML
* SASS
* fastercsv (or CSV for ruby 1.9) for csv exports
* formtastic
* UUID

Specific versions of the gem dependencies are listed in the gemspec.

# Contributing, testing

To work on the code, fork this github project. Install [bundler][] if
you don't have it, then run

    $ bundle update

to install all the necessary gems. Then

    $ bundle exec rake testbed

to generate a test app in `testbed`. Now you can run

    $ bundle exec rake spec

to run the specs and

    $ bundle exec rake cucumber

to run the features and start writing tests!
